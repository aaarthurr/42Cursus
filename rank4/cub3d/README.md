42 CUB3D

The Cub3D project is a graphical gaming project developed by LeoHerna and Arpages, inspired by the Backrooms universe. The goal of the project is to simulate a three-dimensional world using only a two-dimensional map. This map provides a top-down view of walls and corridors, defined in a .cub file. To achieve the 3D effect, we implemented a raycasting algorithm, which, while not overly complex, is fascinating to work with.

We enhanced the basic raycasting algorithm available online by adding roof textures and item sprites. Additionally, all the display and movement logic was developed from scratch. The file parsing system is particularly robust, allowing for significant flexibility, such as the choice between textures or colors for the roof.

The game's visuals are built entirely using MiniLibX. To enhance the gameplay experience, we introduced items that act like "drugs," randomly spawning on the map and giving the player various visual effects. While the game itself is relatively simple, its visual effects and unique mechanics make it engaging and immersive.
